# Introduction

# Materials

Assorted Lego blocks, plates, and the like. A few of each color, shape, and style. We used about 15 or 20 plates and bricks. 

# Exercise

Grouping into sets of similar bricks - a variety of options (style, color, etc). Get Creative.

Patterns - what's the next block?

Addition - 1xN blocks, for example 1x2 added to a 1x2 yields 4, 1x2 + 1x4 yields 6, etc. 

Multiplication - four 1x2 bricks yields 8 total dots - 4 time 2!
