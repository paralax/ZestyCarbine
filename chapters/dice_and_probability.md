# Introduction

Basic probability understanding unlocks a lot of understanding of the world and of our perceptions. While the math behind probability is vast and complex, the basics of probability can be taught to a young student with ease. 

For this experiment, we worked with two 6-sided dice to study _uniform probability_; we didn't get into weighted probabilities or skewed distributions at all. 

# Materials

For this exercise, you'll need a pencil and graph paper, and two six sided dice. 

# Exercise

For this exercise, we first looked at a single 6-sided die and talked about it. Each number 1 through 6 appears on it exactly once, and we agreed that the die was likely to land on each number with equal chance. (We talked about this concept a bit, which is an underlying concept here.)

This exercise also allows us to explore the forumlation of a hypothesis - "an idea you can test", eloquently stated by the Dinosaur Train cartoon from his younger days - and recording data. We didn't do any experimental design for this, dad did all of that work. 

To begin the first exercise, I asked my son to pick the number he predicted would come up most frequently with enough rolls of a single 6-sided die. He picked the number five. We then rolled the dice about 30 times and recorded the number of times each number came up. The table below summarizes the observations. 

| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 6 | 3 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 |

As you can see from the table while there were more 1s than anything else and fewer 3s than anything else, the distribution was largely flat. We talked a bit about how that could be and used that illustrate the concept of equal probabilities. 

The next phase of the experiment used _two_ 6-sided dice. Again, we made sure the dice were fair and each number had a chance of coming up fairly. Again, I asked him to pick a number he predicted would come up most frequently - his hypothesis - and he chose 10. I also asked him to take the numbers shown below - 1 through 16 - and draw for me the resulting histogram to show a probabilty. After some explanation of what I meant ("think of it as like a mountain range with peaks indicating how many times you think that sum will appear"), he drew a rough density plot with squiggly lines with a peak around 10. 

A careful reader here will think "hey, two six sided dice ... you can't get 1 or any number larger than 12." That's part of the experiment! 

We began our experiment and rolled the dice 40 times and recorded our observations. Our findings are summarized in the chart below. 


| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 5 | 3 | 10| 11| 5 | 6 | 1  | 3  | 2  | 0  | 0  | 0  | 0  |


The results sort of surprised him. Remember, he hypothesized that 10 would be the most frequent number - "two times five" from the first experiment. Yet it was 7, with 6 not far behind. We discussed why this is a bit, and he couldn't offer an explanation. To explore why, I then drew a two dimensional chart with the columns and rows numbered 1 through 6. The cells should be the sum of the two dice indicated. I asked him to populate the cells (some good numeracy work, too) and this is what popped out:


|   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |
| 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 |
| 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 |
| 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 |10 |
| 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 |10 |11 |
| 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10|11 |12 |

We then discussed which number appears most frequently - he began by creating a frequency table - but quickly noticed it was 7 that appears most often. We then talked about how this affects the probability that a number will come up. 

# Discussions

With his attention waning, we didn't do much discussion about how this applies to a larger set of concepts. 

# Results

Overall this exercise was well-received by my older son (the younger one didn't participate). It took him a a bit to get into it, but I think we'll build on this in future exercises, like the ones from Helmerich which use odd dice.
