# Introduction

Newton's Law of Cooling relates the rate at which an item's temperature changes in relation to the ambient temperature. Assuming no barriers to thermoequilibrium, heat will be given off or absorbed as things approach the ambient temperature. Things further away from the ambient temperature will approach that temperature faster than things closer to the temperature. 

# Materials

For this experiment we used three Pyrex water containers:

- 2 4 cup measuring vessels
- 1 2 cup measurig vessel

We also used an instant-read digital thermometer I normally use for cooking. 

# Exercise

The experiment was simple: for the given vessels, how will they change temperature over time. 

We used 2 cups of water for all experiments but heated the water to different hot temperatures to begin. The 2 cup container and one of the 4 cup containers were filled with tap water and heated for 3 minutes in the microwave. The remaining 4 cup container was filled with hot water from the tap. 

The experiment was designed to illustrate the effects of surface area on heat exchange, but to keep the volume constant (2 cups). The two 4 cup containers also varied the initial temperature.

To begin the experiment I asked the boys to propose a hypothesis - "an idea you can test" - about how the temperatures would change - would they stay the same, rise, or cool. They debated a bit, but when they decided it would cool, I asked if they thought they would cool at different rates. They had said no.

For the experiment we took and recorded temperature readings (in centrigrade) every few minutes and recorded the time (in seconds since the experiment began) and the resulting temperature.

At the end of the experiment - about 20 minutes, discussing the entire time - we then graphed the results on three lines for each of the hot water vessels.

An oversight: we did not record the ambient temperature.

# Discussions

The purpose of this experiment is to continue to teach the kids about how a scientist formulates a hypothesis, sets up and experiment, records data, and then analyzes it. 

We did not discuss Newton's Law of Cooling before the experiment began, meaning the experiment was designed already (by me). The boys disucssed their hypotheses, but we probably should have structured that a bit more. By the end of the experiment and graphing it (using Google spreadsheets) the boys had exhausted their patience. 

The results that began to emerge after about ten minutes of readings did surprise them, however - the hottest object in the wider vessel (the 4 cup one) was cooling the fastest. They were able to formulate the idea of surface area for heat exchange on their own. 

We did not discuss the mathematics of Newton's Law of Cooling, however. A seperate experiment that may be worthwhile would be to start with *cold* water too and see as it warms.

# Results

I felt this was a successful STEM event with the boys as they explored hypotheses and did data measurement, and could see their ideas validated or negated after some measurements.
